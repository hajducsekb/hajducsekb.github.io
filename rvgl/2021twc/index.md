### All 3 sessions will be hosted by duc (IP: `hb.rv.gl`)

\*These tracks have received modifications since this announcement. On the 12th of January, SBX Alpine was released on revoltzone, you should **redownload it** from there! As for Toy World Winter, the wobbly cones were removed for better network performance. **Make sure to redownload** the track from either the new link, or as part of the Week 3 trackpack!

\*\*\* Skiing Paradise will also be modified a bit, but it shouldn't affect any optimal lines. You can still practice the track on the main route, the issue that exists is on a part of the track where you won't race naturally.

*Note: I don't know if the song on Christmas Special Stage is copyrighted, so if you want to stream/record with music enabled, you might need to remove `levels/christmastest/song.mp3`.*<br>
*Week 2 Note: Same as the above regarding PR: Caves, Tetris Festival and The Great Silence. Their respective paths: `levels/winterwest/custom/music.ogg`, `levels/tetrisfest/custom/tetrisfest.ogg`, `levels/pr_caves/pr_caves.mp3`*<br>
*Week 3 Note: I still can't keep track of the copyright in the music, please keep this in mind if you turn on in-game music and try to stream/record.*

## Signing Up

To sign up, send a dm to either `hajducsekb#3604` or `Frosttbitten#9596` on Discord, or send a message to `@hajducsekb` on Telegram. You can still sign up after the first and second race days, however, you'll obviously be at a disadvantage in terms of points. It turns out that we also got 16 people to sign up, so you can only sign up as a reserve.

## Point System

The sessions will be uploaded to the [RVGL Session Parser](https://online.re-volt.io/sessions/results.php), so the points given out will be 1 point per position. The sessionlogs at the end of the event will be merged, and uploaded seperately, this will decide the results of the tournament.
